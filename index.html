          <p>What is SEO?
            ● Search Engine Optimization (aka SEO)
            ○ Increases both the quality and quantity of traffic on a website
            ○ Requires understanding of what people are searching online, answers they are seeking, the words
            they are using, and the type of content that they consume
            ● Other Terms/Acronyms
            ○ Search Engines: a web-based tool that allows users to find things on the web
            ■ Google, Bing, Yahoo!, Yandex
            ○ Search Engine Results Page (aka SERP): the page you see after entering a search query
            ○ Organic search results: a free listing that appears because it's relevant to someone's search terms.
            ○ Search Engine Marketing (aka SEM): paid search advertising
            ● Search Engine Basics
            ○ Search engines scour billions of pieces of content and evaluate thousands of factors to determine
            which content is most likely to answer your query.
            ○ Search engines do all this by discovering and cataloguing all available content on the internet
            through a process known as “crawling and indexing</p>

            ● Provide the user a good way to navigate and interact with your site. Make your HTML code as semantic as
            possible.
            ● Semantic HTML: means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible.
            Semantic elements are elements with a meaning; if you need a button, use the element (and not a
            element).
            ● Headings: to index the structure and content of your web pages.
            ○ Users skim your pages by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document
            structure and the relationships between different sections.
            ○ headings should be used for main headings, followed by  headings, then the less
            important , and so on.
            ● Alt Text: alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view
            it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
            ● lang attribute: should always be included inside the  tag, to declare the language of the Web
            page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
            ● The title attribute specifies extra information about an element.</p>

            ● Canonical tags
            ○ The canonical tag is great for organizing your content and prioritizing one web page
            over a duplicate web page.
            ○ Every website has duplicate web pages.
            ○ This becomes a problem when search engines are trying to rank your content. It
            confuses the search engine, and it ranks each one of these URLs separately.
            ○ To solve this problem, you can use the canonical tag to specify which URL Google
            should pay attention to above all others.</p> <P></P>
